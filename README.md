# Build-with-AddonBuilder
I always find that AddonBuilder was missing the possibilty to build from the contextual menu without launching the application.
Pbo manager has this possibility and I wanted it for Addonbuilder.

Here we go !

## Usage

### Install
If AddonBuilder is not installed on the common folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3 Tools\AddonBuilder) you have to change the path line 3.

Launch Build_With_AddonBuilder-install.bat

### Uninstall
Launch Build_With_AddonBuilder-uninstall.bat

### How does it work ?
Right click on the folder you want to build. It will create a Pbo in the parent folder.
If you want to pack only without binarise & co, shift right click the folder.
