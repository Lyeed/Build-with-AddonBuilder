# Build-with-AddonBuilder

I always find that AddonBuilder was missing the possibilty to build from the contextual menu without launching the application.
Pbo manager has this possibility and I wanted it for Addonbuilder.

Here we go !

## Usage

Before 

### Install
Launch the install batch file

### Uninstall
Launch the uninstall batch file

### How does it work ?
Right click on the folder you want to build. It will create a Pbo in the parent folder.
If you want to pack only without binarise & co, shift right click the folder.
