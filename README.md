# Build-with-AddonBuilder
I always find that AddonBuilder was missing the possibility to build from the contextual.
PboManager has this possibility and I wanted it for Addonbuilder since Bohemia has changed the way Pbo are build

## Installation
If AddonBuilder is not installed on the common folder
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3 Tools\AddonBuilder) you have to change the path
```
Steps to update my path :
1. Open Install.bat with any text editor
2. Line 5 put your AddonBuilder executable path
3. Save and close

My path is correct :
Launch Install.bat

## Uninstallation
Launch Uninstall.bat

## How does it work ?
Right click on the folder you want to build. It will create a Pbo in the parent folder.
If you want to pack without binarising, shift + right click on the folder.
